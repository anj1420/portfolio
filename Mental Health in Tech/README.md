### Mental Health in the Tech Industry: What features of a company or employee best determine whether or not an employee is comfortable speaking out about mental health?

Group project done in UC Berkeley School of Information's course Data Science W207 (Applied Machine Learning). Our data comes from the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) website (https://osmihelp.org/research), which consists of yearly collected surveys that measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech industry.

My team members and I used classifers to predict the comfort level of an employee to speak with their supervisor/boss about mental health based on features of a company or the employee.

The two notebooks Modeling_2016_to_2019.ipynb and Modeling_2017_to_2019.ipynb contain our analysis, modeling, and key takeways.

Random Forest classifer gave us a 94%+ accuracy.
