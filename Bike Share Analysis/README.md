### Bike Share: Analysis and Recommendations

This was a project for UC Berkeley School of Information's course Data Science W205 (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). 
Tools and languages used: Python, SQL, and Google BigQuery. 


#### Problem Statement
- You're a data scientist at Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so.

- What deals do you offer though? Currently, your company has several options which can change over time. Please visit the website to see the current offers and other marketing information. Frequent offers include:

  - Single Ride
  - Monthly Membership
  - Annual Membership
  - Bike Share for All
  - Access Pass
  - Corporate Membership
  - etc.

Through this project, you will answer these questions:
  - What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"?
  - What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?
